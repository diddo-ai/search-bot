Start with acronyms and generate all the permutations of possible words that equal an acronym. The tool runs like a chat-bot.

For example:

View the frontend on Github Pages built with ReactJS

## Run the app locally

In the react directory and backend directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### Optional Backend

Some example words are hard coded into the frontend so you can see the working app without a backend server.

### Dependencies

Node 16.0.0

NPM 7.10.0

1. Cannot find module natejs
